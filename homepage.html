            <h4>A sleeping pad for on the go</h4>
            <p>If you are an <strong>adventure seeker</strong> like us, you will love this sleeping pad.</p>
            <p>We have actually <strong>created it for ourselves</strong>, being on a bike the whole day it can be truly exhausting. Some days you just want to sit down enjoy the sun, the wind and the wild.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, conventional sleeping pads didn’t allow for a quick set up. Their blowing mechanism actually makes you never want to set it up ever again. You probably remember how <strong>out of breath</strong> you were, completely exhausted.</p>

            <h4>Enjoy the view and watch your friends struggle</h4>
            <p>Due to the pain that conventional sleeping pads have inflicted us, we decided to try a self-inflatable sleeping pad.</p>
            <p>Well, that <strong>didn’t even fit</strong> on our bikes.</p>
            <p>So finally, we gave up and made our own. After 18 different prototypes and a lot of hours, we made an exceptional sleeping pad, that we now use daily.</p>
